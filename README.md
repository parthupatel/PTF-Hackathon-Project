## Inspiration
The primary way to obtain NFTs on our website is to acquire them in marketplaces that accept cryptocurrencies such as ETHEREUM, BITSKI, and FORTMATIC. There is currently no mechanism to exchange NFTs with complete trust.

Assume you are exchanging NFTs with someone. You must agree that one of you will send an NFT to the other first, and the other will respond with an NFT. In this instance, there is a possibility that the person who receives the NFT first will steal it, making it difficult to trade NFTs with confidence. As a result, we created a new platform that allows for the distributed blockchain direct transfer of NFTs.

I aim to create an open and safe NFT marketplace for everyone. This will be a challenge for both me and the contributors. Together we will create a reliable and beautiful NFT marketplace example.
 
## What it does
NFTARC is a platform for the direct exchange of NFTs. To accomplish the exchange between users. Coming to the project idea – Wallet Basically, A wallet that allows you to spend your ethers. you’ll create a smart contract that is able to receive ethers from other addresses and transfer ethers to other addresses.
 
When you want to list an NFT, you send the NFT from your wallet to your Container.

When bidding on an NFT, the bidder sends the NFT from their wallet to your Container via their Container. The entire procedure is carried out in real-time, with the consumer accepting by tapping a button on the frontend app.

NFT is among the offers received, and the NFT exchange occurs on your Canister. No one can freely operate their Canister and can only do the actions that have been programmed, thus making the exchange of NFTs. 
 
## How we built it
We have built this complete website using some languages, frameworks, platforms, cloud services, and APIs  also updated the price list of NFT items. We have special care so that the customer or a bidder does not face any problem in buying any items, so we have used 9 different and various types of wallets.

## Challenges we ran into
We have front-end developers, and designers on our team, so we can easily create websites with UI/UX design using some languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

The team members were preoccupied with their studies as we are all B.TECH 7th-semester students, which made it challenging for us to do the project in the allotted time.

Since there isn't a lot of information on this NFT barter project online, we had to conduct a lot of experiments to determine the specifics and the best coding approaches.
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We developed frontend functionality for the sequence of exhibiting, bidding, selection, and withdrawal for demonstrating the actual exchange using NFTs.

We gave documentation on this extent to create it simple for other designers to understand.

We wrote sufficient test codes.

We create websites in wonderful UI/UX designs which are very easy to use for users.
 
## What we learned
We learned how to develop codes for transferring NFT ownership.

We discovered how the Internet Computer scales.

We learned about how to manage many NFT item creators, buyers, and also NFT expert bloggers on one platform at a time.
 
## What's next for NFTARC - A Place Where Barter the NFTs.
Keeping track of exchange histories.

Implementation in the backend function

Create a functionality that enables NFT owners to communicate with one another.

Integration with Plug and Wallet.

We built this website in the three most common Communication languages: English, Hindi, and French.
